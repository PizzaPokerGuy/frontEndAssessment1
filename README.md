## Install Instructions
- npm install http-server -g
- Start server http-server
- Should default to http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/

## Notes
- Chrome apparantly needs a server to do standard routing or throws a CORs error which is why the server is needed. I apologize for this as I have been using UI-Router with a server for a while and didn't anticipate this, but wanted to get the project back to you the next day. 
- If you don't want to install the dependencies they also simultaneously pop up in a modal. 
- Last and most importantly please hire me ;)
